# Angular Project

## Functionality

First of all you need to get your access-token on the website that you can find by clicking on the [link](https://gorest.co.in/consumer/login) in the Login page. After submitting it in the appropriate input field you can navigate to the other components: the User-list and Post-list. In the User page you can view the users, delete them and also add some more, furthermore you can view the user-detail by clicking the icon on the left-side of each box (in that page you can also see the user's posts and the comments about them); while in the Post-list you can view all the posts and the comments, but also you can delete them, write some more or even search the one that you prefer.  

## Libraries 

I've used two main libraries: 
* the RxJS in order to handle the asynchronous functions;
* the Angular Material to build the component's template

## General Information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
